# This project uses machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Data Mining. 
Linear Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm that works and operates on numeric data.
A database constituting of numeric data is very necessary for the algorithm.
The algorithm the trains the data and after testing it uses it to carry out prediction.
The system basically entails the use of data mining,
a technique in machine learning where data is created and trained to be able to predict out some desired outputs.
